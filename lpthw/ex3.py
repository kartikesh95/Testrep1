# Exercise 3: Numbers and Math

print("I will now count my chickens:") # Print the contents within the string

print("Hens", 25 + 30 / 6) # Print the word Hens followed by its count = 25 + (30/6) = 25 + 5.0 = 30.0
print("Roosters", 100 - 25 * 3 % 4) # Print the word Roosers followed by its count = 100 - (25*3) % 4 = 100 - (75 % 4) = 100 - 3 = 97

print("Now I will count the eggs:") # Print the contents within the string

print(3 + 2 + 1 - 5 + 4 % 2 - 1 / 4 + 6) # Print Egg count = 3+2+1-5+0

print("Is it true that 3 + 2 < 5 - 7?") # Print the contents within the string

print(3 + 2 < 5 - 7) # print the output of (3+2) < (5-7), which is false, as 5 not less than -2

print("What is 3 + 2?", 3 + 2) # print the output of 3+2
print("What is 5 - 7?", 5 - 7) # print the output of 3-7

print("Oh, that's why it's False.") # Print the contents within the string

print("How about some more.") # Print the contents within the string

print("Is it greater?", 5 > -2) # print the output of the calculation, i.e. true
print("Is it greater or equal?", 5 >= -2) # print the output of the calculation, i.e. true
print("Is it less or equal?", 5 <= -2) # print the output of the calculation, i.e. false
